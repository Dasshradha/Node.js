# Book Store Management API
Book Store Management API is a Node.js/Express-based API that allows users to manage a collection of books. The API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books, along with user registration and authentication. Reviews for books can be added, modified, and deleted by users. This project utilizes MongoDB for data storage and implements asynchronous functions, promises, and error handling.

The API has been thoroughly tested using Postman, an API development and testing tool.

Features:
User Authentication: Registration and login functionality.
Book Management: Add, update, and retrieve books by title, author, or ISBN.
Review System: Users can add, modify, and delete reviews for books.
Async & Promises: Efficient handling of asynchronous operations with callbacks and promises.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error messages and status codes.
API Testing with Postman: The API functionality is thoroughly tested using Postman.
